# Horizon Calculator Web App

Created by Neil Bassett, this web app shows users the apparent horizon profile from a point on Earth, given by a latitude/longitude coordinate. The algorithm to calculate the horizon profile from elevation data was developed and published in [Bassett et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...923...33B/abstract).

The App front-end utilizes the ReactJS library.
